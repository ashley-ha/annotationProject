Movie,Review
Harry Potter,"There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."
Harry Potter,"Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"
Harry Potter,"Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget."
Harry Potter,"Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids, loosely taken from the source. Was I ever wrong? "
Harry Potter,"I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy."
Harry Potter,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books."
Harry Potter,"Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out."
Harry Potter,"I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
Harry Potter,"in 2001, in the film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, began one of the best sagas of all time, based on the book of the same name by JK Rowling, the film hit full in the cast, all actors are great in their characters, Daniel Radcliffe this impeccable as Harry Potter, the resemblance is too large, Rupert Grint this great as Ron Weasley, Emma excellent Watson as Hermione Granger, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Richard Harris as Dumbledore (which unfortunately from the third movie substituted series, having deceased), Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman great as Snape, Ian Hart, Tom Felton, and etc, all goods, the special effects are great, the picture is great, especially the castles, the soundtrack is very good, and full of great moments, as the final, obvious that the movie has errors, the script has some problems, and the film is very long, I think it was longer than it should, and the film is faithful to the book, even with some missing characters, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good film, and marks the beginning of the saga of the Wizard in the movies. Note 8.2"
Harry Potter,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan."
Harry Potter,"When I first saw this movie I was ten years old, the same age the characters where supposed to be. My older cousin and her boyfriend took me to the Mall to watch a movie. Back then I wasn't going very often to the cinema, due to the fact that my parents didn't have time and I wasn't old enough to go alone to any theater. The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn't had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it. That's how I became obsessed with reading and writing."
Harry Potter,"During my childhood, the earlier Harry Potter books got me into the franchise and especially Fantasy Literature in general. They had thought provoking writing, likeable characters, and compelling world building. Then I saw this movie adaptation of The Sorcerer's Stone (The Philosopher's Stone in the UK) back in theaters and loved it. It's not a perfect film I'll admit, but it's a very good start to a successful fantasy movie franchise."
Harry Potter,"To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" hits the screen."
Harry Potter,"This movie captures most aspects of the book perfectly. Being the first in the franchise, it has to do a lot of world building. But the writers and the director of this movie managed to keep things simple and to the point."
Harry Potter,"Over-hyped but still enjoyable ""event"" movie, one of the biggest of 2001 until LORD OF THE RINGS comes out, and a film in which every million of the budget is put up on screen in the special effects. What I found most refreshing about this blockbuster is that the entire cast is made up of British actors and actresses! It makes a change for an expensive blockbuster movie to be thus but there you go, HARRY POTTER is indeed a unique movie. Now I'm not one of those people with lots of time on their hands to read the never-ending Harry Potter books (too busy watching cult movies I'm afraid), but the film has turned out pretty much as I would have expected from the adverts. Although it's overly sentimental (blame it on director Chris Columbus) and aimed at children, adults can still enjoy it for the excellent pacing (rarely does the two-and-a-half hour running time drag) and the plethora of special - and some not so special - effects on view throughout."
Harry Potter,"Not a perfect story, but a lovely introduction into these characters and J. K. Rowling's magical world of wizards. Lots of great bits here, like the sorting hat, invisibility cloak, troll encounter, and quidditch match (even if the rules for this game are absurd). The casting is excellent, including the principal three (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) and the teachers at Hogwarts (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Richard Harris). The film was a little too long and had scenes that seemed a little disconnected, leading to a rather brief, anticlimactic ending, but overall there's a reason the franchise was so popular, and this got it off the ground in good form."
Harry Potter,HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)
Harry Potter,Harry Potter is a magical and fun movie.
Harry Potter,"It's seem like just yesterday, when the movie about the boy whom lived, was about to come out. People were wondering if the Harry Potter's books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone AKA Sorcerer's Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form: its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn't play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley's family when he knows that they're horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don't care if they're wizards in training, I'm surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn't as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times. A good example of this stupidity, is punishing students whom went out at nights, by sending them out at nights in the dark forest, where they can get attacked by creatures. The most insulting thing in logic is the black/white one-dimensional view of good Vs evil. Honestly, how on earth is the members of Slytherin never got expulsion for all the bullies that it has? You would think, that at less, there would be one good person in Slytherin. Another thing that bugs me is the whole the power of love conquer all. I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter's film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they're saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It's so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn't aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling's first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn't good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying ""philosopher's"" and once with ""sorcerer's"". Overall: The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan."
Harry Potter,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) 
Harry Potter,"The right way to start a saga like this one, introducing the characters in a very positive and unique way, telling and showcasing all the riches that the wizard's world is a home of. In only one movie, we've seen amazing creatures, friendly and foes, teachers that are heroes and villains, we've witnessed the wisdom of the legendary professor Dumbldor, the movie made us guess who will be who and on who's side in the chapters to come and above all, we had fun. I will never forget the part where Harry buys all the things he needs to start his wizard journey, the authentic look of the streets, the shops and the bank will be part of the Harry Potter legacy forever."
Harry Potter,"To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director's nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!"
Harry Potter,"That's it! I give up! I surrender! White flag! My friends want to see the new Harry Potter that is about to be released this summer, The Order of Phoenix, but they looked at my like I just lost my head when I told them I never saw the Harry Potter films. They just said I've seen every movie yet I never saw Harry Potter? Well, I never saw the point since I don't read the books or wasn't interested in the films, it looked like typical kid's stuff to me. But my friends said they would not take me to see the movie until I've seen the films, it's now that I realize I got myself into trouble since these movies are all 2+ hours each. I just finished the first one a couple days ago."
Harry Potter,"We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film."
Harry Potter,"First episode also known as ¨Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone¨ deal with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)and friends fighting dark forces in an amazing adventure . In this early installment of JK Rowling saga, our protagonist is freed by Rubeus from the custody of his selfish uncle (Richard Griffiths) and miserable aunt (Fiona Lewis). Harry goes his destiny at Hogwart's school , there meets our friends Ron(Rupert Grint) ,Hermione(Emma Watson) and his enemies Braco Malfoy(Tom Felton), along the dark forces which threatens Hogwart, and finally Lord Voldemor . Besides the professors as Minerva(Maggie Smith), Severus Snape(Alan Rickman), Dumbledore ( Richard Harris), Madame Hooch (Zoe Wanamaker), Quirinus (Ian Hart)and of course Rubeus(Robbie Coltrane). Here some legendary events take place , including a Quiddich match, and Harry Potter competes in confronting in series of dangerous happenings , challenging monsters as unicorn, centaur and horrible creatures and an ending spooky climatic battle ."
Harry Potter,"I watched all Harry Potter movies when I was 7 years old. After five years I watched the movies again at 12 years old and I feel this saga a classic, well, it is a classic. I started reading the first book like one day ago. Which my mom gave to me when I was a little kid. I like Harry Potter a lot and I would watch all the saga again"
Harry Potter,"Harry Potter movies are one of my favorite ones, and I can watch them several times. I watch it every time it's on TV, and there is one channel that shows all the series of this incredible movie every time after the new year. I also want to mention that even my family members like to watch it with me. My grandmother especially likes it. This fact indicates that this movie is interesting not only for children but also for elderly people and it's not weird for me. There are so many things going on in this movie, so many secrets and beautiful scenes. Plus a big thanks for the graphics of the movie, everything is very realistic. For example, the mermaids or the dinosaurs. Moreover, there is a massive animatronic creature in this movie- spider and after watching the movie google about it and found out that Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron Weasley, one of the main characters, is afraid of spiders just s much as his character is, and said it was easily the scariest scenes to film. I'm scared of spiders too, and I know how it feels when you see them. Thus, I really appreciate the job that this actor did. In my opinion, despite the fact that he had to play again a guy, who was scaring from spiders, it is again hard to play the role by looking at the creature that gives you goosebumps. Thus, this movie not only good in graphics, but also the cast."
Harry Potter,"No, I'm not a big Harry Potter fan and probably never will be but I can appreciate the qualities of the movies. Definitely for a children movie this movie is of course of very high class, with fabulous looking sets, a whole load of well known British actors and an highly experienced crew involved."
Harry Potter,"Having just watched HP7A aka Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, my mind flies back - almost magically, one might say - to the film which started it all."
Harry Potter,"Cool! I'm so sorry because in 21 years of my life, I've only seen a movie as cool as this. Harry potter, in my first impression, I was amazed and curious about how the next series of this film will be. Watching this film evokes a feeling of dark academia that was buried in the past. Even though this film was produced in 2001, but the quality is quite good and even not inferior to films produced now."
Harry Potter,"When I knew the film was being made, I thought how could they make a film that would be up to the standard of such a perfect book. But they did! Sure they missed bits out but they captured the essence of the book brilliantly. One member of the cast was mis-cast for me but my children disagreed.I even found myself believing they were flying and not wondering ""how are they doing that?"" So 10 out 10 Warner Brothers. Bring on the next one!"
Harry Potter,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, this is the first film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about a young boy (Harry Potter) who is rescued from the clutches of a neglectful aunt and uncle and a bratty cousin, and taken to study witchcraft at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he meets his future lifelong friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger, witches Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall and the school's all-powerful headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Harry also learns about his connection with the evil dark lord, Lord Voldemort."
Harry Potter,"If for nothing else, the Harry Potter films always find a way to give me a great sense of nostalgia. I, like many others, grew up with this franchise. In many ways, this was our generation's Star Wars. It was the 2000's pop culture phenomena. I'm happy to say that the first film, The Sorcerer's Stone, still undoubtedly holds up."
Harry Potter,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast. It's a delight to watch, I've seen this movie numerous times and it never fails to make me smile, to cheer me up when I'm feeling down, the Harry Potter franchise is magical both inside and out, and it's simple fun to watch Harry go in to his first year at Hogwarts, the story's quite simple as the series kicks off with a light start, but it will still leave you wanting more. The films biggest flaw is, at times, it is too faithful to the book that it is based off, I'm sure this is pleasing for anyone who's read the book, but for those who haven't it tends to drag out at times, more than an hour passes before Potter even goes to Hogwarts and the main adventure dosen't unfold properly until at least one hundred minutes in, it can get a little tedious at times and that's why I'm giving it an eight instead of a nine that it easily could have received. The cast is outstanding, the young cast members are ridiculously talented for their age, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have no trouble playing a lead role, and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine as his closest friends, they never lose a single bit of likability. They are joined by a terrific adult cast, including the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and, the highlight of the movie for me, Richard Harris, he shines as Professor Dumbledore (sadly only for two movies), his characterization is perfect, he is wise, heartwarming and simply a lovable character. It may be a bit slow at times, but Harry Potter and the Philiosopher's Stone never loses its sense of fun and magic, and because of this it is a perfect film for the whole family to watch and enjoy. "
Harry Potter,"I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience."
Harry Potter,"I watch this movie again in 2019, because i think it was an amazing movie n i miss the point of the movie when i watch it as a child. I only focusing on the magic thing.
Its good for a children to watch this movie i think, it tells not only about friendship, but also family, bravery and sincerity.
Watching this also makes me remember my childhood days, it bring back all memories i cherish the most.
really love it"
Harry Potter,10/10 - an unforgettable start to a fantastic film series and the career of the impeccable Emma Watson (and the other kids)
Harry Potter,"Okay, I never read the Harry Potter Books. I couldn't have cared less, but I have nieces and nephews and other children in my life who are from ages 7 to 12 who have. What I had to do was remember what it was like when I was that age, so long ago, and what ""new"" movies I had to entertain myself with."
Harry Potter,A legendary beginning to a legendary franchise. The story of the film is great. Each role fits perfectly with the actor. Has great CGI and visuals. Can't stress this enough... go watch it.
Harry Potter,Platform number 9(3/4) would have been discovered easily by muggle world as train platform are not that empty.
Harry Potter,"All the Harry Potter films in this series are pretty good. Some are better than others, but over-all, the seven together is quite a motion picture experience. This one is the first one in the series and is the best one to get started with. This first film is so well produced, that it should satisfy you enough to watch even more of them. This film also works on its own. That is good, in case, you never get a chance to see another one again in your life. Start with the first one I always say. Being the first film also means, I have seen it the most. I saw this film as soon as it landed on DVD, then when I realized there would be a seven or eight film run on the Harry Potter series, i stopped watching them and waited for all of them to be released in a DVD package, which I finally finished in 2017. This film still works great today as it did 20 years ago."
Harry Potter,This movie is a delight for those of all ages.
Harry Potter,"Dropped with his aunt and uncle as a baby, Harry grows up in a loveless home and is made to sleep under the stairs.  On his 11th birthday Harry learns the truth of his past when he is visited by Rubeus Hagrid and invited to attend Hogwart's school for wizards and witches.  Whilst learning his craft Harry and his friends notice some strange things and begin to investigate, leading them deeper into a mystery that involves a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents and a quest for a powerful stone that brings immortality."
Harry Potter,"Sorcerer stone is a pretty good film which introduces us with harry potter and his friends. Just like the kids in Hogwarts, audience are also in awe with the magic. But I felt that this lacked a story which is only revealed towards end. But still this is my second most favorite harry potter film after chamber of secrets."
Harry Potter,Directed By: Chris Columbus
Harry Potter,"It was amazing to watch how a huge movie franchise started with this one. It showed a basis for the entire Harry Potter timeline. The visual effects were very great for this film. It was on-point and did not feel amateurish. Unfortunately for me, everything else was a bit stale and unexciting. I was in doubt of whether it really maximized its runtime. There were, in some parts, too many scenes which the characters were doing a lot of dialogues. The production design and costumes were excellent aspects of the film, too. But for me a lot of dark cinematography was utilized, instead of a more lively kind of production."
Harry Potter,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is what a book adaptation should be. The only things left out of the movie were very minor. This tells the story of a boy whose parents were killed when he was young and been mistreated by his aunt and uncle. He receives a letter about a school named Hogwarts. There, in his first year with his friends Ron and Hermione, he must stop wrongdoing of a couple teachers. The cast was wonderfully casted. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic and looks the part of Harry. Everyone else is perfect. As I mentioned above, the adaptation is great. The movie even used the same quotations as the books. The music is memorable. I liked John William's Hedwig Theme. The costumes are good-looking and so is everything else. This movie will leave a magical imprint on your minds and this is only the first film. I rate this magical adventure 10/10."
Harry Potter,I have recently been revisiting the Harry Potter franchise during the ongoing pandemic and I have been wondering whether these movie that I hadn't seen in a decade would have aged well or not. My conclusion is that most of them have aged particularly well and this is especially the case for the first two movies that I consider the best of the franchise. The producers' idea to hire veteran director Chris Columbus was certainly a decisive one in hindsight since he managed to transform a first novel with numerous lengths into an extremely entertaining film for the entire family.
Harry Potter,"wow, wow, wow! The Harry Potter movies and books will always have a special place in my heart!! I love them so much and this is the one that started it all! It is so fun, great, and energetic and Daniel Radcliffe is perfect for Harry. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are great and there is such amazing chemistry between all of them! I love all the movies and books."
Harry Potter,"This masterpiece must be preserved perfectly to all the generations to come. This is a genius simple story that everyone can relete to sometime in their life. Every humans desire to escape from reality for a while, this excellent film series is one of the greatest series, if not the greatest and never gets old."
Harry Potter,"It's hard to imagine just how influential the Harry Potter series has been on my life. It was released around the time I was born, and I can't really ever remember a time when it wasn't my favorite world to escape into. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book I can remember becoming a fan of, and wanting to read it again straight away. I'm not even going to pretend that I can judge this without bringing over my fondness for the books."
Harry Potter,"I have, in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema, hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative, more ugly, more uninteresting, more lacking in suspense, more lacking in charm, more greedy, more incoherent... Okay, okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse, and, yes, off the top of my head, I can think of many that are worse. However, for a book that over 125 million people have read, and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history, and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises, and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation, I am more than severely disappointed. I know that, had it not been so overhyped, it would have been just as bad. Now, however, my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come."
Harry Potter,While I look back on this first entry into the Harry Potter series fondly it is not with out a few problems with adaption from the books. Our trio of main actors are very young and as a result we get plently of chessey acting. Looking back however it is great too see the beginning roots of the characters that we get very attached too through out the series. We get too see them grow as actors. A great cast was put together that stayed more or less the same through out the whole franchise. The effects in the movie are handled well for its time despite Harry not actually using any magic. Even though there are better movies in the series I will always look forward to watching this entry.
Harry Potter,"Not being a reader of the Harry Potter books, I came to the first Harry Potter movie with a totally open mind. There seems to be those who love the book but hate the film; those that love both; and even a few who hate both! Having watched Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, I must confess that I'm not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. This strikes me as solid but unremarkable, totally overlong but fairly diverting fare."
Harry Potter,Harry Potter is an orphan living with his ignorant uncle and aunt under their stairs. He finds out that he is actually a wizard and there is a secret world out there.
Harry Potter,"With the sixth book now out (and one more to go), I feel that I should review ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". By now, the Harry Potter books have become so well entrenched in our culture that I don't even need to explain the story. But I can say that director Chris Columbus did a great job adapting the book to the silver screen."
Harry Potter,"Well, for starters, the older cast, almost all of whom are instantly recognizable if you've seen much of British television or film, are simply delightful in their roles, with special honors going to Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, and Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid. Some other positive aspects to the film is that it is a faithful adaptation for the most part, and the child actors certainly aren't the worst I've ever seen. Moreover, John Williams' brilliant score was at the time one of the best in years."
Harry Potter,"This first Harry Potter surprised me. Not a reader of the books nor a proponent of occult beliefs, I still went into this with an open mind and found I enjoyed the movie. I watched the first three films and own the third (""Harry Potter and Prisoner Of Azkaban"")."
Harry Potter,"Of all the Harry Potter's movies, I guess the ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' was the more more expected of all. I was one of the thousands of teenagers who wanted to watch this movie so badly and I watched it in the first week it came here in Brazil. After 4 Harry Potter's movies, now I feel comfortable to say that the first movie is the one I liked the least. Maybe because it is the one who has less adventure or danger of all, but I cannot say exactly why. I think it will be very difficult for me, being crazy for Harry Potter's books, to give 10 in any of the H.P.'s movies, since the book is SO MUCH better than any of the films. I mean, MANY great parts are never showed in the movies. But if you are one of those people who never read any Harry Potter book, this film will be of vital importance to watch since it is the first of the series."
Harry Potter,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" or sometimes also ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is the first film from one of the most successful movie franchises in cinema history. The books were written by Joanne K. Rowling and adapted by Steve Kloves (not a name to many), who also directed ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" earlier in his career. It is about a small boy with hidden powers, who is not particularly liked by his uncle, aunt and cousin. They took care of him after his parents died when he was a baby. So he gets picked up by an unusually looking, rather gruff magician and taken to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is not a normal school. While the bonding with fellow students, the fraternities and sports activities are there as well, everything is just a little bit more magical and different."
Harry Potter,"First off, I am going to give my modern day thoughts on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone since I just now watched it for the first time in about 10½ years. And then, I will tell my story. I will begin with the positives to be nice. To be generous."
Harry Potter,Surprisingly good. 
Harry Potter,"I was drawn into the story the moment the letters started whirling through the air to ""the boy under the cupboard"" and to the amusing trio (Aunt, Uncle, brother) that give interest to the early scenes and make you anxious for Harry to escape life in this demented household. And from the opening scene on, the special effects are nothing short of marvelous despite what some ""critics"" here are calling ""cheesy"" -- I'm sure the film is a strong contender in that category for a Best Special Effects Oscar."
Harry Potter,"Orphaned not long after his birth, ""Harry Potter"" (Daniel Radcliffe) is forced to live in the home of his only living relatives who treat him rather badly. That all changes one day when he is informed by a man named ""Rebeus Hagrid"" (Robbie Coltrane) that his parents were famous magicians and because of that he is invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Needless to say, Harry accepts almost immediately and after Hagrid and he buy the necessary school equipment he begins his journey to the mystical academy. It's then that he meets two fellow students named ""Ron Weasley"" (Rupert Grint) and ""Hermione Granger"" (Emma Watson) who become his good friends and share in his triumphs and travails. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was based on the very successful book ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" by J.K. Rowling and from what I understand remains quite faithful to the book. At least for the most part. In any case, I found it to be a fine fantasy film with the interaction between Harry and his two friends especially entertaining. Admittedly, there are some slow parts here and there and it does run a bit long (152 minutes). Even so, despite the faults just mentioned, I believe this to be one of those rare movies which can be enjoyed by the entire family and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
Harry Potter,I'm finally in a position to re-watch and review the Harry Potter film series - I'm way past over due for reviewing them.
Harry Potter,"I know I'm probably the only one that didn't care for this film, but I thought it was plain boring. The adaptation of the book is just OK and the acting is average. Frankly it's a pity to see all the great English actors in this film totally wasted and relegated to play second fiddle. The effects are very well done, but it's such a conventional treatment of the books that I kept checking my watch a few times to see when was it going to be over. It's very curious that hardly any of the young people in the audience didn't laugh at all. This Harry Potter is very heavy handed and it should have emphasized the fun and could have used a few lighter moments."
Harry Potter,"If you watch ""Sorcerer's Stone"" without reading the book first, there are certain narrative points that you will miss or not quite be as clear on (as usual). However, watching the movie closely following the reading experience will actually expand upon the Potter myth (I gave the first book four stars) due to this film's ability to lay the groundwork of the series in such stunning visuals and characters."
Harry Potter,"With billions upon billions of pounds in revenue generated from book sales, film adaptations and all other mediums, and with the hysteria surrounding the series now all but gone, it seemed the perfect time to re-visit the Harry Potter film franchise. I'll state outright that I'm a fan of the books: they are hardly ground-breaking pieces of literature, but they are a meticulously crafted and widely imaginative set of novels, maturing with it's progression and with the age of it's characters and readers. The movie adaptations were consistently average, fiercely loyal to J.K. Rowling's prose but always somewhat lacking in substance."
Harry Potter,"My sister, bless her heart, used to work in a bookstore, and brought the novel this turkey is based upon home one day. After everyone else in my family had read it, I decided to give it a go because I had little better to do at the time. I wound up throwing the book across the room in around thirty pages, feeling that not only had my intelligence been insulted, so too had the already-persecuted-enough faiths of Wicca and its pagan relatives."
Harry Potter,"Literally anyone could write this story. Nothing is original, the effects are mostly bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad and the music score was written by John Williams 25 years ago (if you get my meaning)."
Harry Potter,"In the first outing for Harry Potter, he learns of his descent from a magical background and enrols at the school of witchcraft and wizardry 'Hogwarts'"
Harry Potter,"My sister and I, back when I was ten, wouldn't even go near anything Harry Potter-related, despite its immense popularity at the time; we'd call Harry Potter ""Hairy Pothead"" and laugh at the nerdy glasses he wore on the book and DVD covers. Anyway, recently we decided it was time to see what made Harry Potter fans so raving mad over a little boy with superpowers and a geeky school uniform, and it was a nerdy children's movie but not nearly as bad as we thought! The main character, Harry, is a seemingly average boy living in the U.K. with his aunt, uncle, and spoiled overweight cousin, Dudley (great name choice). When Harry begins discovering strange powers in himself, his aunt and uncle do everything in THEIR power to keep the truth a secret from him, but when Harry finds out he's a wizard and is given an invite to a secluded boarding school for wizards and witches, he eagerly accepts, wanting to be with kids like himself. From there he picks up two misfit friends, meets a snotty rival with way too much gel in his bleached hair, and meets a variety of teachers, including a perverse, hawk-like old guy with emo hair and a hooked nose."
Harry Potter,"Cut about an hour out of the middle of HARRY POTTER and you'll have a pretty decent little movie.  As is, it's a bloated mess.  There's no heart to this, no characterizations.  It's just a product reel for all the special effects companies that worked on it."
Harry Potter,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. The franchise has been a large part of my life for most of my life. With the first book coming out when I was three years old and the first movie when I was seven, there is a special place in my heart for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter."
Harry Potter,"'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is one of the most entertaining films I know. You can look at it and not worry about anything because you know it will all be alright. Very true to the book it reaches the same level. Daniel Radcliffe is the perfect Harry Potter, Emma Watson a great Hermione and Rupert Grint a very funny Ron Weasly. With the famous story, a great direction from 'Home Alone'-director Chris Columbus, a perfect casting and some nice special effects this is the way a movie like this has to be. Be entertained by the world of the wizards."
Harry Potter,"I love the Harry Potter books because of their brilliant writing, exciting and funny moments, compelling characters and the way that I'm hooked as soon as I pick one up. They deserved to be such a phenomenon. The films? Not so much. This starts off the adaptations in OK style, and follows Harry Potter's attempts to stop the evil sorcerer who killed his parents getting a stone which will help him return to power."
Harry Potter,"I have seen this movie numerous times on TV, but I was never able to watch it in it's entirety some reason until today where I managed to watch it all and it did not disappoint. The story is just really intriguing right from the start where you introduced to the character Harry Potter who is just very likeable which makes you root for him against his so called family. The world of Hogwarts is amazing and makes you want to wish it was a real place. The story is easy to follow and it's not predictable which I liked as there are a few twists which just make the movie even more thrilling. I have seen bits of the other movies on TV as well and I hope they are as good if not better as this."
Harry Potter,This was such a brilliantly done film. Well Harry Potter is a brilliantly done franchise in general. But the Sorcerers Stone (or Philosophers Stone) is a well done beginning for this franchise. The character development in this franchise is absolutely fantastic. You get instantly attached to the main and side characters instantly. All the actors did a great job and gave funny and fun performances. The overall feel of this movie is so magical and has such a fun feel. I have never seen a movie World get you so attached more quickly then Harry Potter. Overall this film was awesome and I highly recommend it.
Harry Potter,Why all the glowing comments?  This is one lame movie.  Haven't we seen these types of special effects enough already?  The acting was lame.  The story was lame.  The pace was slow.  The scenes overly long and trite.  I was bored out of my mind.  
Harry Potter,"I've read every harry Potter book available and was fascinated with them. The world and characters J.K. Rowling created are marvelous, these are going to be fantasy classics in books. What about the movies?"
Harry Potter,Spoilers herein.
Harry Potter,"I think I may sound like a stooge if I say this, but it is now that I have finally watched this movie. Throughout my life - school days, college, internet; I often used to see people going non-stop about Harry Potter (I think they are called Potterheads). Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that. So finally yesterday I decided to give it a try and oh my god, it's amazing! Why didn't I see it back when I had the chance to?"
Harry Potter,"About halfway through Harry Potter 1, I considered walking out.  It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated."
Harry Potter,Initially I was against this series because the kids leave such huge messes at the cinema where I work. Then I decided to rent the first movie and give it a look to see what it is the kids love about it so much. Then it hit me: it's the story of a no talent underdog who overcomes great obstacles with a little help from his friends. And who doesn't like that?
Harry Potter,"What else can I say about the world of Harry Potter that hasn't been said already? After the first book came out, everyone was going crazy for Harry Potter. But then Potterheads minds were blown when in 2001, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released. The film was directed by Chris Columbus and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, Ian Hart, John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, and Julie Walters. The film was a huge success financially and critically and luckily won fans of the books over and continued with seven more films plus three spinoff films."
Harry Potter,Columbus did a fantastic job directing the two Potter movies for use fans since 2001 2002 and producing Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. But I will always appreciate Chris Columbus directing on Harry Potter and Percy Jackson . I hope he does another Harry Potter movie or Percy Jackson movie cause he has a better imagination like Peter Jackson.
Harry Potter,"How sad it is to begin the reader's comments with a whining, complaining, drone against everything about this movie. Why not pick a balanced view. Good grief! Did someone poison your dog? It made it sound like this doesn't compare favorably with ""Hamburger: The Movie."" I am a over fifty years old and thought I would be pretty lukewarm to a ""kids"" movie. I have been listening for a year to kids raving about the Harry Potter books. Their eyes light up--they are enthused about a ""book."" When I went to see it, I had just read the book the night before because I like to see how they translate. The script was delightful. The characters were charming. The acting in this movie is wonderful--were you expecting Bergman? The pacing is delightful. The sets are eerie and forbidding. I thought that the wonderment of the characters was there in full force. Who did you have in mind to play Harry? Are there any actors that you approve of? Perhaps Kevin Spacy should have played Harry. How about the blond girl from American Beauty as Hermione. Johnny Depp as Ron Weasley. Oh yeah--as I recall, Stephen Spielberg has made a couple of pretty decent movies."
Harry Potter,"I don`t rate JK Rowling as a writer so when the hype machine stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE ( As it`s called in Britain ) was going to be faithful to the book I thought this was a film that wasn`t worth seeing but I decided to give it a chance , after all I hadn`t expected much from THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING but I ended up falling in love with Peter Jackson`s beautiful masterpiece . But after watching THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE my instincts had been proved right and in many ways the film had lived down to expectations ."
Harry Potter,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is as magical a film as a fantasy bedtime story or any fantasy that can pop up in any child's head.I have never read any of the books,so I will not compare those books to this film.The film is very imaginative and the visual effects and art direction are wonderful.This is only a short review and I am hoping to post a longer review.All I can say is that this film was alot of fun to watch."
Harry Potter,"You know what?  I'm getting sick of reading comments by people who are tearing this movie apart, saying it twists mythology, it is unimaginative, it is done simply for cold cash, etc..  Well, a lot of these people are the same ones who will go see the same action movie over and over again, despite the lack of plot and talent.  Hollywood just does not make good family movies anymore that are not animated, and I think that is very well done. The child actors are wonderful and have great timing for actors of their age.  Just enjoy it!"
Harry Potter,"If you don't know your Potter (like me), than you might have a problem with the titles. With other series, it's easier to distinguish, which one is part 1, 2, 3 etc. etc. Even the Naked Gun series which has Parts 2 and half and 33 and a third, you still know the order (not of the Phoenix obviously!) ;o) "
Harry Potter,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, based on the novel it seems every kid has read (to my surprise considering that I hated reading most books as a kid, especially ones that looked longer than 200 pages and had little or no pictures but then I'm not a kid anymore) is now a movie and while it is certainly overrated and sometimes stupid, it gives some decent moments of entertainment.  It is another film that will depend on the viewer on how much he/she can take with near non-stop adventure and (impressive) visual effects.  It's a wonder the film made 93 million in one weekend (isn't that a sign of biblical armageddon though), but since the film is directed a lot more at kids it's not a total surprise since the movie gets a big reccomendation in the family film department.  But teens and adults might not want to walk in the theater prepared to see the greatest film since Wizard of Oz like the kids are.  "
Harry Potter,"There were many plot changes to accommodate the adaptation of this literary work to film. But what bothered me more were the obvious comparisons to the 1986 TV movie ""The Worst Witch,"" in which many of the main characters of this work seem to have appeared. "
Harry Potter,"Harry Potter seems to highlight what today's society is missing; the age of magical innocence, the pure abandonment of that essence of childhood. In this day and age of computer games and quick fix takeaway electronic happiness and incessant CGI violence, it's brilliant to see the world excited by story telling and the simple things. It reminds me of years ago as a child reading volumes of Roald Dahl's compositions and hanging out to read the next chapter of 'Danny the Champion of the World'. Harry Potter has engaged the world back into that innocence, even if it is for a two hour movie."
Harry Potter,"When the movie first came out, I was hesitant about seeing it because I was so enamored of the J.K. Rowling book. Therefore, I avoided it at the theater. When I finally bought the DVD I was sorry I hadn't seen it at the theater as I found that the movie was a truly worthy adaptation of the book. "
Harry Potter,"Lacking any real magic, Harry Potter was a lifeless film, composed of a plotless story and forgettable performances. While watching the Neverending Story last night, a true children's classic, it really hit me how wonderful a movie Harry Potter could have been if only they'd been willing to deviate from the book for a second."
Harry Potter,"I have been re-viewing the Potter films in order, building up to the last two installments, which I have yet to see. Watching them in order allows me to judge which were, in my humble opinion, are better than others."
Harry Potter,HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE 
Harry Potter,"This Harry Potter movie is my childhood, but also my favorite one, like the heroine so cute"
Harry Potter,"Hurrendous! Daniel Radcliffe absolutely destroys this film. He has no experience and he loves and enjoys himself far too much for anyone else to enjoy the film. The facial expressions, the looks and the lack of acting capability was so tragic it wasn't funny! Emma Watson and Rupert Grint gave decent performances. And Maggie SMith ruled supreme. A few good moments but the lead star dragged the film down so much it was unbearably bad! Sorry a 3. Plot was pathetic and Daniel wrecked it!"
Star Wars,"Three movies in to the final part of what is being called the Skywalker Saga and I have to confess: worse than not knowing anything about these new characters -- Poe Dameron, Finn and Rey -- I honestly don't care about them. They're ciphers that we only know the barest of things about. Why does Finn have such an affinity for his friends? Why should we care a lick about Poe when he's proven to be too headstrong and willing to leave people behind, yet has nothing redeeming to make up for it? And Rey has every single skill of the Jedi near-instantly, almost a way too perfect character to be true."
Star Wars,"A hot mess of a movie, with terrible writing, dim acting and clunky direction."
Star Wars,"This movie introduced an absurd amount of inconsistencies, to the point where either they purposely reversed the whole point of the first 6 films to slap Lucas and his fans in the face, or they never watched any of the previous films at all. First I'll talk about what I liked."
Star Wars,"The good:
Cinematography
Music"
Star Wars,"A tragic culmination of the flaws of the previous 2 films. Whether due to his own lack of imagination, studio meddling, or the previous abomination that Rian Johnson directed, JJ Abrams has wholly and utterly failed to deliver a satisfying end to this abysmal trilogy."
Star Wars,"They are so used to making films for four-year olds that they thought the force is magic. There are magical and inexplicable wizardry happening all the time. Who knew 'Jedi' can heal the drying and mortally wounded? All those Jedi didn't need to die in episodes I-III! If only Yoda had known!!
It is not just that nurse Rey is so magical. People fly, people transport items across the galaxy, people come back from the dead and intervene/assist/interfere and the list continues."
Star Wars,"As someone who has loved star wars ever since I was 6 , this is genuinely disappointing. This whole trilogy is an insult to George Lucas."
Star Wars,"I LOVE Star Wars films and couldn't see this film fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was quite boring. Did anyone even edit this film? Rey's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Chewie. Leia died of shame. Nothing happened anyone cared about. The dialogue was not clever. The film never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of magical occurrences. People galloping on horses (read that again). Magic over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently."
Star Wars,... which is that there was no overarching story to this trilogy planned.
Star Wars,"When did Star Wars become Micheal Bay's Transformers? I know it's pretty much impossible to consistently follow-up the train wreck of The Last Jedi, but is this really the best they could come up with?"
Star Wars,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker is a soulless film and a commemoration piece.
Star Wars,"Letting JJ whatever his name is and Rian Johnson write the sequel trilogy is a complete disservice to fans these 3 movies are the worst in Star Wars history. Thank god for The Mandalorian, Rogue One, Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Solo wasn't bad."
Star Wars,"This movie was just straight-up painful to watch, with so many stupid scenes. The constant bathos and unearned character moments made me sick. It feels so on the nose the entire running time, and the plot is just completely absurd. This just felt like a bad joke."
Star Wars,So it motivated me to finally register and add my own reviews.
Star Wars,"Saw 'The Rise of Skywalker' just before Christmas with my sister, but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it. Being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film. Will admit that when seeing it in the cinema, to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults. Since watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' then though, the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations. My reservations felt back then still remain the same, as well as what struck me was good, while thinking of more since."
Star Wars,"I recently saw a review on YouTube that made me think about this last Disney trilogy and I almost came to accept that maybe I was wrong and the story arc for Luke and Leia made sense. But then I realize that these movies had very little to do with any of the original movies characters and I digress. How Disney has turned this into a cash cow is shameless, greedy and inmoral. From the very beginning I expected a more dramatic movie, these characters have been with us for forty years! I don't understand why Mark Hamil was ignored when writing the script to these movies, nor why did these movies need a new story when there are decades of comics and books with lore and great stories? Disney had a once in a lifetime opportunity to conclude what George Lucas started almost half a century later, and they decided to turn this over to people who never read the source material nor cared about lore. During all these years Mark H never stopped being Luke and Carrie was Leia, they never took on roles that they were known for more. It saddens me that we will never have a memory of all our beloved original characters together for at least one scene at the end of this all."
Star Wars,"It has been quite some time since I got excited about this franchise; I guess the TV shows maybe are doing more at the minute, but for the films there is little to get excited about within them, and probably far too many of them being made for all the 'proper' fan to make it a date. Rise of Skywalker had been largely panned by viewers and critics, but I decided it was a good Friday night sort of film - one that doesn't take too much effort to watch. I was correct because this film really doesn't have much of a plot to care about, and seems to have been patched together without a lot of thought to the whole."
Star Wars,"In a galaxy far, far away ... so begins a couple of hours of a really poor portrayal of middle school level science or actually a good portrayal of failing m. s. science. For however far into the future we humans, if we're still here, will be exploring it might be to nearby stars w/robotics let alone the 100 billion of stars in our galaxy & further let alone some other galaxy. And, we won't be dressed, talking, behaving like early 20th century Americans. This film has the same predictable special effects CGI we've been seeing for decades. Same old Earth life comically modified into alien life. Dialogue really dumbed down and made even more incongruous given the technical level of each character."
Star Wars,"What is the Disney Star Wars trilogy about? If you can summarize it in one sentence what will it be? You might say is the story of a scavenger girl searching for her origin. But was Ray really searching for her origins in TFA? Most likely her origins were encountered by luck; then denied in TLJ; then forced back again in TROS. So no, the trilogy wasn't about her origins. You might say it was about the journey of becoming a Jedi. But that would be also incorrect since the main character is a Jedi since day one without any particular training. Finally, you might say it's the sequel for the Skywalker family saga. But that also would be incorrect since in TLJ it is very clear stated that family and origins are not important and Ray is nobody. Anybody can be a Jedi. That fact is very well illustrated in the final scene of that movie where a kid without training is using the force with a broom. It's about friendship? The characters barely get to know each other. It's about the constant fight between good and evil inside our souls? The main character is flawless, saviour like, no real threat is summon upon her. So, what the hell are these movies about? My friends, you will find more character development in any Latin soup opera than in these movies. Sad ending for such a franchise."
Star Wars,"This new Star Wars trilogy is a tragedy, and the plot makes no sense in TROS, it just wasn't built up at all from the previous movies and is completely disconnected. And this new trilogy (specially TLJ and TROS) totally nullify everything story wise before it. To put it short Space Balls had more respect for Star Wars than Disney, and JJ makes Michael Bay look like Steven Spielberg. So as a long time Star Wars fan i will just pretend the new trilogy never existed and stick with the first 1-6 movies and Rouge One."
Star Wars,"The Jedi who were massacared at the Academy. The Jedi whom the emperor slayed. The Jedi who died in battle or were shot down in the arena. They all did not need to die. After all, doctor Rey here (Bad Robot University Alum. 2015) could have waved her hand, focused, grimaced for 2 second and voila all is good.
And no stupid Jedi training needed either. Take that Yoda. Take that Kenobi. Heck take that The Force, Jedi, et cetra."
Star Wars,"I had a thought watching this, ""How did Disney allow this clusterfk to happen?""
But then it all made sense (or cents). It's the Disney approach to commodifying our childhood stories and fantasies and turning it into a production line, churning out identical, packaged goods all in one colour. (In other words, the same crap over and over again)."
Star Wars,"I went to see this new Star Wars movie tonight--a few weeks after it opened to tepid reviews. Well, after seeing it I can understand some of the lack of enthusiasm for ""The Rise of Skywalker"", as it suffers from a HUGE problem...I felt pretty much indifferent to it. I would have preferred it if the movie has really sucked...then I would have had fun laughing at it."
Star Wars,"As soon as it was revealed that Rey is the granddaughter of Palpatine, and that Palpatine somehow still lives(!!???), I was officially done with this trilogy."
Star Wars,"Absolutely a disgrace to writing and cinematography. Breaks established lore, pacing is horrendous, several things are just left in the movie and never followed up upon, and you do not have time to connect with any characters. It is so terrible that it is not even fun to make fun of it, it just makes you sad."
Star Wars,"To start this off I want to clarify that I don't hold any of the Marvel movies in an extremely high regard but they are at least coherent and also produced in the same house or umbrella of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Disney has been successfully replicating and recycling their formula and intellectual properties for maximum market appeal and audience comfort.
Yet somehow, after setting off to a promising start, Disney Star Wars continuously managed to fall flat on it's face. And I believe this happen for a very simple reason.
Terrible writing.
Disney Star Wars has yet to hire an incompetent director but when it comes to the planing and writing they are leagues behind Disney Marvel. (Isn't this just the worst sentence ever?)
What bugs me the most is that basically every department but production did an outstanding job. Yes, even the writers.
I'm specifically referring to whatever creative genius though it would be a great idea to combine six different scripts into one nonsense show of epic proportions. They actually utter the words: ""Somehow Palpatine returned.""
That's the sound of the screenwriter giving up.
As inexplicably as he comes back though, he dies, again, equally inexplicably.
And if you think you have an answer for how or why events took place the way they did without saying ""The Force done did it."" I'll become your very own personal slave.
This movie doesn't have plot-holes it has plot-craters.
I'm sure all this made sense at some point until they microwaved it, froze it, microwaved it again, toasted it and garnished it with weapons grade uranium.
That's what people like right?
I'm not saying you actually couldn't enjoy yourself, after all maybe you really don't care about anything making any sense at all. Maybe you're just here for the spectacle.
In that way you could almost call this movie fine, if pretty bloated.
But I'm not trying to spoil your fun. I'm just one of those annoying snobs that holds the art-form of film-making in high regard.
Anyways, worst Star Wars film with the obvious exception being the Holiday Special.
Let's just keep talking though.. since I have barely touched on the Disney Marvel comparison yet, let's give that a go.
Marvel has characters with character. Not all of them, for sure, and mostly it's pretty shallow, but it's absolutely there. Disney Star Wars doesn't have that. They have place holders. People who eventually will do something once the writers figure out who they are. With Fin probably being the least consistent. So essentially we get the copies of the old cast in feel and look and the literal old cast on top. Nobody is allowed any agency or character traits that weren't previously popular unless they are contemporarily popular.
Which serves a single function: Making the moneys.
Marvel is making quite a lot more money though, which brings me back to the
How?-Factor. How could they mess up so bad?
Aren't there already a mass of popular Star Wars books and comics and what not. Is it really important to the Star Wars experience to see the old cast again?
Actually no.. Even though the George Lucas Star Wars prequels are dreadful, they went with a completely different story approach and still made a ton of cash especially in the merchandise department. What this shows is that there is no need to weasel people in with the sweet taste of nostalgia. Returning to the Star Wars universe is enough as long as you're actually telling an interesting cohesive story. The Last Jedi had the most meat on it's bone but I want to believe after getting upset with the producers, Ryan Johnson just wrote a bunch of twists and turns specifically designed to render his own movie and the Star Wars - Recycling Project as a whole null and void. Seriously the last 20 minutes of that movie basically make fun of the previous two hours. If this actually was a giant troll-move it makes perfect sense.
The rest of Disney Star Wars is not even worth mentioning as all other entries are painfully mediocre. Just 90 - 120 minutes of nothing much.
Most notably the Rise of Skywalker has solidified this latest trilogy as subjectively worse than the prequels. Those may be technically inferior in almost every aspect but they had a far more reaching and superior cultural impact.
Finally, the Rise of Skywalker almost classifies as a ""So bad it's good""-Movie if it wasn't far all the wasted potential on display."
Star Wars,"This and the entire sequel trilogy is nothing more than a billion dollar corporate money grab. It has just as much claim to being serious as the Star Wars Holiday Special does. Heck, the Holiday Special had all the original actors!
These people? So bad they are not even aware of their own ignorance."
Star Wars,When I saw the very first Star Wars movie at the Theatre decades ago I got pretty much everyone I knew and his dog to go and watch it.
Star Wars,"I heard this movie was bad but I had no idea it was going to be this bad; it was probably even worse than the Last Jedi and that's says all you need to know. Of course, it isn't all JJ Abram's fault for several reasons:"
Star Wars,"TROS combines the obvious, simplistic conclusion to an arc that Return of the Jedi had with rushed and emotionless attempts at character development. I think when evaluating the sequel trilogy, the issue of a lack of a consistent narrative across the trilogy hurts all three films in the larger story, so I mostly consider each film on its own merits. Each of them and the trilogy would have been much better off with a single writer and vision of the direction the trilogy should go, but since we didn't have that, each movie should just be judged on its own merits. On those grounds, The Rise of Skywalker fails to convince the audience of its character arcs or generate any investment in the inevitable outcome. Rey is severely underwritten, as we don't know to what extent she's really tempted by the Sith or her reasons for and against; all we get is fear of a vision and her family backstory. Kylo had a crucial arc in the previous film which was promptly thrown out the window here in favor of literally the same arc, just done worse. Once again he is told by a higher power to kill Rey, and while he initially tries to turn her, he eventually sides with her. We get a bizarre scene with Han where Kylo is sad and apparently coming around, but it rings hollow because we've seen it before and none of the reasons behind the turn this time are shown. Plenty of plot points don't make sense (how does Palpatine return? lazy writing anyways; how does Rey using a second light saber give her the upper hand? Why doesn't she have all the Sith rush into her as she was assured would happen moments before?), but even beyond that, no emotional beats in the film hit because it's all so contrived. This film feels most on the side of personal rather than true galactic stakes, as we only see effects on others when all the ships come in at the end, and those personal stakes never feel real because of the inevitability of the ending. The Rey/Kylo romance felt really strange, death is toyed with repeatedly for no reason (Chewbacca, Palpatine, Rey, and that girl Poe is into are all examples of this), and Rey going to Tattooine and calling herself Skywalker was the perfect nonsensical bow on top of the absurd film. I think some of the directions they try to take the movie are reasonable, but are poor choices given the decision to retcon the previous film and how little time they have to build different character arcs. Rather than build on VIII or set more realistic character goals for this one, they went all in and made a film that's hollow from start to finish. While it's representative of the disjointed trilogy overall, it's a shame that such a beloved franchise ended so underwhelmingly."
Star Wars,"Good, it was fun while it lasted Disney, finely crafted, pricey joke, now where is the real bunch of sequels?.. oh.."
Star Wars,"Don't watch this. Its like a transformers movie, just exsisting to sell toys."
Star Wars,"So... here's the summary: Palpatine is back, somehow, with a fleet of planet killing Stardestroyers, as if we weren't tired of those already. He decides to have them in the First Order so he can take over the Galaxy again."
Star Wars,This is perhaps the last in a long line of crapola films by george lucas who made a real killing on the proceeds about a galaxy far far away ... there is nothing of value in any of these films except a lesson in how to avoid being trapped in a big budget film that never ends yet collects millions of dollars for doing nothing
Star Wars,"A terrible movie for Star Wars, cinema or art fans.
It crushes the force and takes Mary Sue-ism and unexplained occurrences to a new height. Frankly, and we have known this all along, the actors and actresses are poor."
Star Wars,"News that is. Very good news.
It is the last one. We don't have to see this cast and crew again (until sequel time in 2021)."
Star Wars,In this film:
Star Wars,"The apparent end of the Star Wars franchise was what I expected. I don't see how they would expand the franchise beyond here, and I hope that they don't. Carrie Fisher deserves to rest in peace."
Star Wars,"Does this even qualify as a movie? Yes, the images move at twenty-four frames a second, but as a story, this is the biggest mess I have ever seen, a mishmash of Macguffins, convenient idiocy to move the plot along, and new flashy Force powers to comb away problems when they arise and the writer cannot come up with a more clever resolution. All the actors seem checked out and I cannot blame them: it's like every movie in this misbegotten trilogy, rather than building on the movie before it, just wants to press the reset button over and over. How can you play a character that way?"
Star Wars,Or yet another Ghostbusters!
Star Wars,"Embarrassing
If there was a lower rating than 1, this film would deserve it. Was this written by a remedial Sunday school class? The rise (hahahaahaaaaa) is a selfish, stupid, and harmful film. If this movie was satire and called ""Bulls**t"", I would still give it a ZREO for even giving screen time to this nonsense. Geez... really, humans."
Star Wars,"Thank GOD it's over, but mercifully, and the highest praise I can give this movie: the 141 minutes, unbelievably, flew by. Unlike the previous installment that was a tad longer, but felt twice as long."
Star Wars,"Positives:
"
Star Wars,"Despite the Last Jedi's misdeeds, I still had some faith and potential ideas for this film's hopes, but as one would expect Disney canned those because they just don't care. Rey is a stale protagonist that nobody cares about, and honestly is so op and emotional that she'd be better off as a sith rather than a jedi. That was my hope, that Rey would turn to the dark side while Kylo would return to the light. That possibly could've saved this film for me, but no, it wasn't meant to be."
Star Wars,"After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, I (and many other lifelong Star Wars fans) had hoped that lessons would have been learned at the House of Mouse, and that the final film in Lucas's proposed nine-movie saga would end the franchise on a high. Sadly, this is not the case."
Star Wars,"This was just rubbish, totally trashed the Star Wars storyline. So basically the palpatine name wiped out the skywalker line and assumed the skywalker name in the end. Just complete junk.....I cannot believe this movie is rated so well. The 3 new Star Wars that came out totally ruined the franchise. The story is terrible, it's too rushed, and just does not have the Star Wars feel. It would have been infinitely better if Rey had actually been a skywalker, but no she's a flipping palpatine!!Palpatine!!! Complete garbage, these episodes need to be forgotten, and Disney needs to go back to the drawing board and get Lucas to direct them again. I mean, they had all the books there that could have drawn from, people would have been immensely happy had they just gone by what's already there, and built off of that, but no, They went off on their own stupid, ridiculous ideas that make no sense and, make it feel like every other trash, empty Hollywood blockbuster that has ever come out. COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Star Wars,"Tick box agenda:
1) Bad screenplay - check
2) Bad casting - check
3) CGIdiocy - check
4) sketchy editing - check
5) subpar soundtrack - check
6) adequate cinematography - check
7) overall lameness - check
8) bad ending - check
9) childhood memories rewritten - check"
Star Wars,"Unforgivably busy and somehow utterly bland. The harder it tries, the sillier it gets. And THAT'S what's GOOD about it! The script is a disaster of epic scale, the characters wooden, the logic completely juvenile, ""Skywalker"" takes all of the philosophical and ethical depth of ""The Last Jedi"" and throws it out the airlock."
Star Wars,"They had the budget, they had the crew, they had talent, they had everything needed to make an amazing movie and they dropped the ball so hard it poked a hole through time and space the same way a singularity does. Even if this movie was a neutron star it still couldn't pull me in."
Star Wars,"A mess of a movie to end a messy trilogy. No explanation of Palpatine's return. Ren serving Palpatine all of a sudden. No explanation for Knights of Ren. Redemption of Ren. Over powered Rey. Leia was apparently trained as a Jedi. Palpatine ""long have I waited"" to be killed by my grand daughter so she can be empress. Why would he wait to rise again to give up all his power by saying ""kill me"". So much trying to fix Ep 8...THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DONT MAKE AN OVER ARCHING STORY FOR THE TRILOGY. MOVIE MAKING 101. WRITE YOUR STORY. THIS TRILOGY IS A MESS AND BACKED JJ INTO A CORNER & NOW WE END UP WITH AN AWFUL FINALE FOR A 40 YEAR SAGA. Characters are dropped from Ep 8, irrelevant new characters. Hated her saying Rey Skywalker & Ben/Rey kiss....Just SO disappointed. Only thing K Kennedy has done I've liked is Mandalorian and Rogue One, her trilogy is AWFUL. MAKE A PLAN WHEN ATTEMPTING A TRILOGY."
Star Wars,"What's so exhausting is the fact that this is a sequence of noisy scenes edited together without proper rhythm or room for true feelings. It's a constant overkill of special effects, chases, contrived over-dramatic dialog, explosions, all without ever taking any risk. You know from minute one that no lead will die or get hurt, and only puppets/living props will."
Star Wars,Watching this Disney film makes me notice that the titles are nonsense. Where do they get these titles from? In the first one the force does not awaken. mostly because it is inconsistent with the force. It is always there and never sleeps. In the next one we do not have a last jedi or the series would have ended. And here all Skywalkers are dead. Rey trying to fit herself is laughable of course.
Star Wars,I couldn't have imagined a worse effort and follow up to TLJ in my wildest nightmares. The Rise of Skywalker is a truly horrific Frankensteinian mess of a movie.
Star Wars,Abysmal!!
Star Wars,"The art of good film making has been lost in the last decade. A whole lot of structural and continuity issues here with a weak script that gives JJ Abrams the opportunity to sell games and merchandise. The main actress has only one expression like she is angry at herself, as well as the audience.
Suggestion: there are only 6 episodes of Star Wars ever and only 3 of them are good."
Star Wars,They have horses (yup horses) on the outside of a starship galloping while the star destroyer is in motion and beating the weaponry of the empire in terms of speed*!
Star Wars,"The final piece in a trainwreck of a trilogy, doomed to fail by corporate greed rushing these films out with no planned story at all, and it shows.
This film feels like it's missing JJ Abrams' 8th film.
The villain is rushed, elements of TLJ are either swept under the rug or very quickly resolved.
I'm not saying that TLJ was without flaws, because it's got pleeeenty of those. That being said, at least it had a direction. Had this film embraced that direction, I think we could've had a 6 or a 7 out of 10 rather than a 3. Everything is confused, and rushed, and the fact that the story is so awful means I can't appreciate really cool things like Adam Driver's acting, the VFX, cool new mechanics like the force co-op play between the two."
Star Wars,As the dotard has honesty and candour.
Star Wars,I was going to see this movie. In spite of my severe disappointment with episode VIII I was going to see episode IX. I have 40 years invested in this franchise so I had to finish.
Star Wars,"I'm not sure wether it's worse or better than Episode VIII. This movie is just utter chaos. Pretty much every scene is created for spectacle or heavy-handed characterization. The majority are hamfistedly lifted from the first trilogy. Famous EPIV-VI imagery is crowbared in without any sensitivity for the symbolism. ""You like Emporer Palpatine, right?"" Disney seems to shout in dispair."
Star Wars,A big thanks to Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley for getting me trough this new trilogy. Not that it felt like a trilogy or a complete story arc. 'The Last Jedi' did just too much damage for anyone to fix it. But hiring the guy who wrote the screenplay for Batman v Superman wasn't helping either.
Star Wars,"Let me say this... In no way is The Rise of Skywalker a perfect movie, it has its flaws. But that doesn't change the fact that I loved it. Yes it has tons of fan service. Yes most of the events were predictable. And still... It was everything I want Star Wars to be. Funny, exciting, a bit odd sometimes but with a group of loveable characters at it's core. Say what you will, but I loved Star Wars since I was 6 years old and this new movie just made me feel like a very happy kid again."
Star Wars,"Okay, let's review the evidence you have after you see a good movie."
Star Wars,"""The Rise of Skywalker"" was a film many had mixed feelings about. Some hoped it would fix undesirable elements of the previous film. Others felt it could continue a daring and unexpected route for the franchise. Regardless of where you stand, it's hard to argue that Rise of Skywalker succeeded in no task that made many happy."
Star Wars,"Jar Jar Abrams is like a child who has been given an expensive Lego set for Christmas. A child too young to follow the detailed instructions and instead smashes pieces together haphazardly. The child then presents this monstrosity to the adults who coo and praise over the child for being so clever but the creation isn't the Death Star, or the Tractor, or the Truck. The childs creation has all the right pieces but no finished product. And that's how I feel about the Star Wars IX, I'm like the parent, I'm disappointed. But I do have a modicum of respect for Abrams because that other kid next door, Rhian, couldn't even stick two blocks together."
Star Wars,"6.7?? Should be 1.7.
I am very sad to see this movie was not any good. People who rated this movie above 4 just don't have heart nor have common sense, in other terms: cast and crew. Bad Robot interns."
Star Wars,"It is Battlefield earth!
Decades old aircraft rise from the depths and water and are staffed and ready to go!?!?!?"
Star Wars,Reflective Engagement
Star Wars,Early on in this movie there is a scene where Poe is 'lightspeed-skipping' to escape the First Order. This pretty much sums up the final movie in the Star Wars trilogy.
Star Wars,Star wars was always about the acting the story the drama and then a little bit of dance with lightsabers. But no Disney had to buy lucasfilms and ruin it all with its lethargic irritating Easter egg hunt out of nowhere!
Star Wars,"If you were to take a step back and think about all the different plot sequences (short events), they look good on the surface: fast-paced action, good dialog, humor, characters from previous movies, lots of cool worlds and great F/X."
Star Wars,"This movie makes no sense. The story jumps from McGuffin to McGuffin, things just happen randomly to keep the movie going and the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. Finn, one of the main characters of the first sequel movie, is now basically an extra and it's sad to see him reduced to a delivery machine for bad jokes. Don't think so? Well, John Boyega does. This is basically a bad fan fiction with Jar Jar Abrams desperately trying to fix Rian Johnson's middle finger to the Star Wars fans, unfortunately he fails miserably. After mastering every single Jedi skill without ever hearing of it and beating an experienced user of the dark side with ease, Rey Sue can now heal and revive people with the force - maybe she should do the same to Disney's Star Wars. Avoid this movie if you are a Star Wars fan and enjoy good story telling in general. Watch it if you don't care about Star Wars but are easily entertained. If coherent plot, respectful handling of your favorite characters and logic aren't your thing you can definitely find joy in the excellent CGI, cinematography and mostly good acting. We've come to a point where computer animations are so stunning that they make people believe they were watching something good - just look at the massive success of the Transformers movies. At least they didn't turn Optimus Prime into a hermit that lost all his positive vibes and just wants the Decepticons to win while drinking green milk directly from some alien tiddys."
Star Wars,I laughed out loud when I read the text crawl at the Beginn because I saw it leaked before and thought it was fake because it sounded so stupid.
Star Wars,"Having witnessed TROS a week ago and realising that it required a moment to process, I went about re-watching its predecessors. I had never really registered the prequels as anything more than schlocky fun, but putting myself into the shoes of ardent fans waiting with baited breath at the turn of the century, TPM becomes more than just a disappointment. The political discourse aims for complexity but its conflicts are resolved with laser swords, the dialogue's delivery gives a fresh meaning to the word monotone, the ethnic stereotypes are at best irritating, and the visual effects are downright ugly. While the podracing sequence has aged relatively well, it's symptomatic of another issue - whoever thought it was a good idea to devote an entire third of Vader's origin story to his dopey pre-teen self? No matter his midichlorian count, the plot itself is inconsequential; the galaxy lies in precarious balance between the light side and the dark, but here he is playing with action figures."
Star Wars,"This isn't George Lucas vision of Star Wars. Neither is it some talented and visionary directors vision of Star Wars. This isn't even a high budgeted and dedicated fan movie. This is basically just a movie made by a committee - a movie made by a corporation, trying to pander and please as many demographics as possible. Like; we need to have 50% men and 50% women in the movie - we need to have 25% Asians, 25% Africans, 25% Hispanics and 25% Caucasians (who of course mostly should be evil). There needs to be 27% action, 23% humor, 15% suspense, 18% romance, 19% nostalgia etc. We need to get the old fans back, and we need to lure new and young ones in. We need to introduce a certain amount of new cute and cool creatures, characters, weapons and vehicles that can be sold as toys and put on merchandise."
Star Wars,She obtains an instant advanced degree in medicine from Mary Sue University (alum 2019) and heals the mortally wounded.
Star Wars,Greetings from Lithuania.
Star Wars,"This movie's weakest point is the writing. It's not a trilogy. It's just three movies with no direction or story to tell. It's obvious that they were just making crap up as they went along. The force can move entire ships, heal people, bring back the dead, and summon an entire lightning storm. Entire plot points have no purpose, because they're undone later on."
Star Wars,"I used to think this was just a mediocre Star Wars movie. However, one day I was discussing the film with a friend of mine, and I realized the movie was garbage. Drenched in plotholes and nonsense, made just for the money. A lot of fanservice but weak storyline. What a shame, Disney."
Star Wars,But I couldn't. It's a disgrace to the Star Wars universe. Jar jar abrams. I don't know where to start but so many have voiced their disgust for the Disney cretins who destroyed this franchise I'm not sure what can be added. Disney needs to wholesale fire everyone at Lucas and start over. Nothing original or even entertaining about it. Jar jar abrams is way overrated. Hollywood is over.
Star Wars,"I don't think anyone would be surprised by now that The Force Awakens was basically A New Hope Remastered with pretty much nothing added to compensate. And, given that The Last Jedi was directed by someone who clearly enjoyed the Holiday Special - JarJar was left with no options. The new emperor(Snoke) is dead, he can't copy The Empire Strikes Back, and thus not The Return of the Jedi, but then JarJar thought... But what if he actually DID copy The Return of the Jedi? But how? Luckily, the expanded universe gave him an answer."
Star Wars,"With the last two episodes, which were un remarquable but not ABYSMALLY bad, people at least expected a somewhat satisfying finale."
Star Wars,"I got to say, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"", has proved me wrong. It's an absolute best final chapter, and far more better than Rian Johnson's ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", because J.J. Abrams and George Lucas has delivered all the great experience in the film, and has delivered the greatest lightsaber duel of all time, that Rian Johnson couldn't deliver in the Last Jedi. There's nothing like the Star Wars series. Episode IX is the final chapter that has a conclusion to the story that is over 40 years of a making. At the beginning of 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope, these are all the story of all 8 Star Wars films to get to Episode IX that is the final chapter of the Skywalker Saga, it has to be Inevitable, Satisfying, Emotional, and Thrilling. J.J. Abrams and George Lucas wants the whole world to see what it's like to feel the ending of Star Wars, as the force will call to us, between the light and the dark side, and we will all feel the force once again. All the main characters and the original characters come together for one very last time for the final saga to end, and it's like nothing you've ever seen before. The previous story of Star Wars have all build and lead to this very last moment. It will go out with a bang, and there is a massive energy to it, that's bigger than anything that I could ever imagine. And it has all the fun. All the excitement, and all the sci-fi action/adventure you'll have to experience in the galaxy, far, far, away..."
Star Wars,"Wow, I can't even believe I'm writing this. I didn't expect much after Episode 8, but I held out some small hope Disney would course correct and deliver a somewhat watchable movie like Rogue One. If anything, I would enjoy Ian McDiarmid hamming it up. But there was truly not one good aspect about this film."
Star Wars,"Nothing, plain nothing, no original plot, just repetitions of previous plot parts, same shootings, same remarks, same rememberings, same too loud music that's supposed to cover the lack of anything else, fights and more fights with no results, everything is same, nothing new, not one moment of originality in more than 2 hours. Hopefully this tiring saga is over now, and please give J.J A. some rest, few years to recover some originality - if he has any left. The reason i gave it 3 stars and not the minimum is the sea scene, stolen from interstellar, but still nice"
Star Wars,"There are so many plotholes and inconsistencies. So, so, so many. The movie does not even follow its own rules. Besides, it feels like four or five movies mashed into one, nothing is ever explained or explored."
Star Wars,In 2015 JJ Abrams had the daunting but almost impossible task to come up with a new Star Wars movie that would not only entertain the critical old fans but also satisfy the new ones. His trick? He introduced new characters and made a remake of A New Hope. For me that worked fine.
Star Wars,"You probably read this before, but Palpatine is alive. How he survivived? Who cares."
Star Wars,"This is the lowest rating I've ever given on the site and rightfully so, I've been a Star Wars fan for over 20 years, they ruined everything that I love about the franchise, in 2 1/2 hours. Just read all the other reviews on this site, that positivity sums up my anger and distaste, In such a disrespectful and degrading way to the originals this piece of $h!t is. I won't say anything more on the subject, in fact I refuse, I've said enough already."
Star Wars,It's almost like a 7 year old wrote the storyline to this film.
Star Wars,"Every since Star Wars was released back in 1977, it was, in a way, meant for kids. Due to its giant success, it was more for everyone than just the kids. Its simple but effective storytelling and its universe created more stories and world-building which gain a much bigger fanbase. Now, we are here with the ending of a continuing saga from 40 years with The Rise of Skywalker."
Star Wars,"This movie is just a mess. If fanbase is mad at Rian Johnson than maybe this movie is perfect for them ... The characters didn't know what to do and J.J. deleted The Last Jedi so this is basically not a trilogy. The only thing I'm happy about is the screentime that Rose got, I couldn't stand her in The Last Jedi. Also, Adam Driver carried this trilogy and that is sad, not because he is a bad actor (he is one of the best actors of this generation) but because it is Star Wars."
Star Wars,"I am a life long Star Wars fan and this was the first time I came out disappointed. And I am not picky, I was mostly happy even with the last two movies, but this one is the worst Star Wars movie yet."
Star Wars,"Can have nothing but mixed feelings about this movie. The constant reliance on nostalgia - every 5 minutes we were revisiting a set from the original trilogy, talking about something that happened in the original trilogy, encountering a character from the original trilogy (or killing them off - oh but no one dies in Star Wars apparently), or seemingly doing an homage to a classic scene from the original trilogy is either a hallmark of Star Wars (i.e. what makes it Star Wars) or proof that there was nothing new here. You have to decide."
Star Wars,"For all of their faults, ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"" are decently fun action adventure movies that both continued the ""Star Wars"" universe and gave us some new and interesting characters. I like Kylo Ren and Rey. I liked Luke's arc in ""The Last Jedi."" I thought these were interesting twists on what we came to expect from ""Star Wars"" movies. Unfortunately, many fans became needlessly upset with the most trivial and pointless things in ""The Last Jedi."" I don't think that that movie was perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that the internet reaction to it was complete overkill. Due to the mixed fan reaction, Disney and Lucasfilm decided to go all-out in trying to appeal to all factions of this divided fanbase in the finale to their new trilogy. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" takes everything interesting that was set up in the previous two films, needlessly tosses it aside, and gives us a regurgitation of ""Return of the Jedi"" with elements from other ""Star Wars"" movies. It is completely over-the-top, nonsensical, and pretty much destroys any of the enjoyment that I had gotten out of this trilogy in the first place. This trilogy will probably go down in history as one of the better examples of how to completely crash and bury a franchise through a lack of vision and by attempting to cater to a whiny fanbase."
Star Wars,"It made tons of money yes,, but for me I wished there was only the original trilogy started in 1977 and it all ended with Empire Strikes Back.. the following 6 films afterwards were completes messes... Everyone gets excited about the trailers then gets let down as there was NOTHING new, just rehashing the original concept over and over and over again.. They had no idea how to handle Hans, Luke and Leah coming back other then to kill off and/or minimize them.. It was a slap in the face to the original movie goers in the 1970's who helped launch the series.. thanks for making our heroes ""ghosts""..."
Star Wars,"How one feels about The Last Jedi (the best Star Wars film) is going to greatly color what one thinks about this film. The film does everything it could to try to undermine that far, far superior film. In doing so this film undermines the entire series AND is just boring on its own merits. Johnson made a certain set of choices-largely around Rey's story-that should either been left alone or Disney should have insisted that Johnson make the choices Abrams does here. If Rey's parents were revealed to be ""special"" in TLJ it would have been lame but structurally correct in the trilogy. That so much of Rise is built around revealing who Rey's *real* parents were the film ends up treading water. That issue was resolved. The resolution that Johnson selected was utterly brilliant-why on earth must everyone be related? Abrams' retcon is unneeded, uninteresting and in this zeitgeist abhorrent. To insist that a hero must have special blood is disgusting especially given that the country is dealing with a resurgent far right. The script twist itself into pretzels to try to satisfy as many fan theories as possible; Rey ends up as sort of the offspring of two powerful families, including being in a way a Skywalker. All this film does is turn Rey's story into Luke's. We have seen that. Can we *please* have something different?"
Star Wars,"The Empire is in chaos. There is a pretender on the throne. A new rebellion is banished to the Outer Rim. The Empire is re-establishing control with yet another Order. At least, it's not another Death Star. It's Disney Plus spaceships with guns. The Mouse Empire muddles on. The new trilogy is simply not planned out. That is its major flaw above all else. This final chapter tries to take back a few story elements and wrap up the story with a bow. It is not to be dissected for plot holes or logic flaws. It rushes to push the franchise across the finish line. It works to some extend and it doesn't cause any more major troubles. Most fans would probably be satisfied with reaching the finish line and not having any more movies for awhile."
Star Wars,"This isn't the worst movie I have ever seen but it is a muddled bag of confusion and so the 5 star rating. JJ should never have been given this movie in my opinion considering the copy cat antics of The Force Awakens which may as well have been an updated version of A New Hope. The same can be said for this movie in parts. Even the Actors seem to be confused in this movie as the acting looks forced As can be seen in their facial expressions. To be fair I know Rian Johnston got slated for The Last Jedi but his vision was above par and the acting was a lot more solid in that movie, in fact I would rate it much higher than that of JJ's efforts. I just wish Rian had got to finish this Saga as I think his vision would have been better than that of JJ's. To finish this Movie is worth it to go and see, but you probably won't want to see it a second time which in my opinion doesn't make for a great movie. As for JJ, I think he has fallen and lost his way because what should have great turned into a confused average movie."
Star Wars,"The Rise of Skywalker is by far the worst Star Wars film. In this film they completely destroyed the character of Finn, making him very unimportant."
Batman,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. "
Batman,"Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell."
Batman,"Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher's childish mess, ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since."
Batman,"British director Christopher Nolan is better known for his lower-profile thrillers such as the excellent MEMENTO and the brilliant INSOMNIA, but his first big-budget Hollywood blockbuster is still in the same league as the other two: a tremendously inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking, which breathes a whole new life into the Batman saga and proves to be the best film of the series (shame it took till number five to get it right, but that's life). Nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines, instead taking Batman back to his roots, and the result is a tough, violent, realistic adventure which isn't marred by any of the comic-book campness or flights of fancy which spoiled the others. Batman is just an ordinary guy here, without any superpowers, but instead his Bond-style gadgets allow him to become the caped crusader by night."
Batman,"A young Bruce Wayne watches in horror, as his parents are killed in front of him, later in life, he vows to remove the criminal element from Gotham City."
Batman,"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL"
Batman,"I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)"
Batman,"BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a ""darker"" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been."
Batman,"To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain."
Batman,"My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film ""contradicts"" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies."
Batman,"I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films."
Batman,"Batman Begins is a well told story of the origin of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale). It covers a lot of the same ground as Michael Keaton's original Batman, but goes much further in depth in many factors of his creation. It goes into great detail about subjects such as how he got his costume, what exactly it is. Same goes with the Batmobile. We also find out why he chose to be bat-like."
Batman,"I loved Batman and Batman Returns, Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's Batman were really good, and seemed to be the best we were ever going to get."
Batman,"Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman."
Batman,"Eight years after the infamous abomination Batman & Robin that killed the Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan stepped in and started a whole new series a darker (even darker than the first two Tim Burton Batman movies) and realistic level. "
Batman,"We waited for years to get a new and better ""Batman"" movie than the one we got back in 1997 with ""Batman & Robin"" which was a complete disaster. This movie is probably the best of all the ""Batman"" movies to ever be released. Christopher Nolan reinvents this iconic character in the most humane way we have ever seen the character in before. It's also the greatest way we have ever seen. Christian Bale is a very good Batman, but I don't believe in his judgment all the time, taking a scene where he is about to kill a man, but fails when the same man is killed by another assassin. I didn't really get his full emotion in that scene, but he is still very good. Liam Neeson is the best villain for Batman to take on as he inhabits the iconic villain Ra's al Ghul who we all know from the comicbooks. This is a great movie that I can't help but love even more every single time I watch the movie."
Batman,"Batman Begins (2005) is actually great reboot of The Dark Knight trilogy and a start of the origin tale of Batman, but is not the best one in the series, that will be The Dark Knight (2008). Batman Begins is strayed from the comic books. My DC comic super hero on a 1st rank will always be Batman I always love Batman from comic books, cartoons and movies more than other superheroes. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it because I thought, it was boring and I didn't got the story. I grew up with Batman (1989) Michael Keaton and I did too loved much more than this one. But than I kept watching and watching it and I fall in love it, It always entertained me. In my opinion Christopher Nolan's and Burton's Batman are all great movies. "
Batman,"To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze ""You're not sending me to the cooler"", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun. D-man."
Batman,Batman Begins (2005) 
Batman,"This latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn''t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman. "
Batman,"This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides."
Batman,"I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, ""This is it! This is the movie!"" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question."
Batman,"The first time I watched ""Batman Begins"" I can't really claim to have been overly impressed with this origins story, and I remember finding the characters sort of plain and the story equally so."
Batman,"Anything I say about this film will sell it short. I was originally skeptical when I saw the Urban Assault Vehicle in the trailer, but my fears were calmed when I saw it in context. Everything about this film is perfect - the acting, the directing, the mood, the plot, and all else. It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department. And fans of the comic will not be disappointed with this apt translation."
Batman,"This is the best Batman film so far. I enjoy for the fact that it was psychological and takes the most realistic approach possible. This was because the director Chris Nolan is known for making psychological thrillers, and he also only used CGI when needed, he made the film using stunts and keeping the action down to earth."
Batman,Batman redone. It gives us a new origin of Batman (Christian Bale) and how he got his powers and such. He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman. His first two villains are the Scarecrow (Cillain Murphy) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul--who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses.
Batman,"Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero."
Batman,"This is the movie The Hulk wanted to be, and failed miserably - the story of the man that turned himself into a legend. While Hulk failed on every conceivable level, though, this ""Batman"" succeeds."
Batman,"Bruce Wayne is not a happy fella. Being trapped in a cave full of bats as a child left him full of fear, and he can only blame himself for the death of his parents at the hands of a typical street thug. However time has perverted this hurt into a bitter, hollow anger that has led him to the Far East where he fights criminals behind bars, seemingly to seek to quench his thirst for what he sees as ""justice"". Taken into a remote training facility for the League of Shadows by Ducard, Wayne learns the arts of deception, movement, combat and others but when he understands that justice is death for this group he leaves and returns to Gotham City. In his absence, the city has fallen into corruption and crime and, seeking a symbol of fear for the criminals, Wayne uses his skills and considerable assets to try and bring down this rule by way of a vigilante personae  The Batman. However, with few allies in this fight, will he be able to counter more than the smaller fish in the pond?"
Batman,"Well, it's official. Batman has gotten his balls back. This film is dark, extremely dark. So dark in fact, there are a great number of scenes filmed, I kid you not, exactly like a horror film. Now, I'm a huge fan of the ""real"" Batman movies. You know, ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" which were done by Tim Burton, starred Michael Keaton, and were carried along by Danny Elfman's rousing musical score. Let's not forget, that old Batmobile from those films. This tank-like monstrous new Batmobile may very well be the coolest car I've personally seen in a movie in ages. Of course, if you're a fan of those rather putrid, embarrassing ""other"" Batman films (Forever & Robin), then you may very well not like this movie. Because it doesn't totally suck like those films did."
Batman,"I feel like I'm always one of those people who rolls their eyes when someone says ""Christopher Nolan is such a great filmmaker"". Sometimes I feel like I'm being a bit mean. Nolan is an acclaimed director because of his vision for big blockbusters that are shot and film and rely on the spectacle of real sets and performances. Nolan exceeds well at what he tries to do, and its a sort of achievement that no director has accomplished. Personally, I don't love his style - it relies more on impressive setpieces then the language of film. But it mostly works. Yet I find this movies to be exactly what Christopher Nolan should not be directing - a fantasy. Because of his vision, and the conflicting interests with this story, I find Batman Begins to be an overlong, drab and rather than unengaging affair."
Batman,"This is the Batman movie I've been waiting for. The popular series has been on hiatus after the terrible 1997's Batman and Robin that nearly ruined the franchise. Well Batman is back and better than ever. In Batman Begins acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan explores the mysterious origins of the legendary Dark Knight. With an all star cast including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Wanatabe, and Morgan Freeman. You can go wrong with a cast like that. Christian Bale steps into the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman. He's phenomenal in the role playing three very distinct characters in one film pulling it off respectively. He plays the angry grown up Bruce who's full of rage and guilt, the arrogant billionaire playboy persona he shows to the public who spends his days dating beautiful super models and buying things that aren't for sale. Christian also plays Batman and he's the perfect choice to bring this popular character to life in ways that none of the other actors were able to no offense. Bale's fantastic in it and makes us care just as much about Bruce as we do Batman. The voice he came up with is fitting for the character and didn't bother me. Michael Caine is superb as Bruce's most trusted butler Alfred providing comic relief and acts as Bruce's conscious keeping him on the right track. Liam Neeson is solid as the mysterious Ducard who is Bruce's mentor. He offers him guidance and eventually becomes one of the films main villains later on in the movie. Liam is effective as both Bruce's mentor and a formidable foe to Batman. Well done. Katie Holmes is good as Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes a childhood friend to Bruce and potential love interest. Gary Oldman is excellent as Jim Gordon one of the only honest cops left in Gotham City. Gary is so good you forget that he's acting. He inhabits the role of Gordon and is perfect for it. Cillian Murphy is exceptionally creepy as Dr. Jonathan Crane better known to comic book fans as the twisted Scarecrow. He's a gifted actor and his character does sort of take a back seat to Ra's in the third act but he was still good as the deranged villain. Tom Wilkinson is terrific as the menacing crime boss Carmine Falcone. He's the first villain Bruce faces when he returns to Gotham as Batman and Tom Wilkinson's role in the film may not be large but he proves to be another effective villain (like Neeson, Murphy, and Wanatabe) in the great ensemble cast. Rutger Hauer is solid as the greedy Mr Earle whose trying to take control of Wayne's company in his limited screen time. Ken Wanatabe's impressive as Ra's Al Ghul the cult leader of the League of Shadows. His part is very brief and he doesn't have much dialogue either but he makes the best of the small role of someone you definitely wouldn't want to mess with. Lastly veteran actor Morgan Freeman is fantastic as scientific genius Lucius Fox who works alone in the forgotten Applied Science Divsison located in the basement of Wayne Enterprises where Bruce finds the tools he needs to become Batman. Lucius helps Bruce in his quest of ridding Gotham of crime and corruption. His character may even very well know Bruce is Batman but there's an unspoken understanding and respect between them that grows into an admiring friendship. I quite honestly can't think of one thing about this movie that I didn't like. From director Christopher Nolan daring vision of bringing Batman into a realistic world to the great all star cast who are good in their roles to the exhilarating action sequences that at least felt very realistic and not something that was made up in a computer and of course the re-imagining the Batmobile known as The Tumbler. This Batmobile is truly unlike any other vehicle you've ever seen and they really did build it so the Tumbler can actually do nearly everything it does in the movie. It gets just enough screen time that makes you wanting more of it but in a good way. Also worth mentioning is the music for the movie by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. It matches perfectly with whats happening on the screen and the tone of the film. Batman Begins is a spectacular adventure with plenty of action especially the second half. It's now one of my favorite movies and I can't wait to see what Christopher Nolan has in stored next for the sequel. Nolan has taken this Batman movie and done justice to the character. It has character development, drama, suspense, and humor (from mostly Caine, Freeman, and some from Bale) with just the right amount of action thats well executed including Bruce's fight with Ra's in the Himalayan monastery perched on a mountain, and an intense chase with Batman in the Tumbler on the streets and rooftops of Gotham. The action packed monorail chase sequence finale will have you on the edge of your seat too and if you're not than something's wrong with you. This film had a great balance of character development, action, drama, suspense, and some humor. Nolan is admirable in making this film crafting an intricate story that's a character driven action crime drama that makes you care about Bruce and Batman while he tries to save Gotham from sinister villains instead of just making it into a special effects extravaganza with zero character development, a poorly written plot, and so-so action sequences. Yeah I'm talking about you Spider-man 3 and Transformers 2. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining action adventure based on a comic book. Go see it. You won't be disappointed with Batman Begins."
Batman,A new movie and an excellent start to the Batman series from Nola
Batman,"""Batman Begins"" is an absolute triumph!! Christopher Nolan has done what Tim Burton and Joel Schlockmacher could not. Give us a caped crusader with a totally believable human side to him. Where the earlier films seemed to be mainly about casting gimmicks, ""Batman Begins"" is purely about the story. And what a terrific story."
Batman,"It's always a challenge to take material from the comic to the screen, and to make it powerful enough, and entertaining enough, without getting overly preachy with the material, getting hyper kinetic with the action, or worst of all losing your audience. The last Batman film, Batman & Robin, committed the later crime, and put a stigma on the franchise for several years. But now there is Christopher Nolan, talented director behind the cult favorite Memento, and the under-rated Insomnia remake of 2002, who has taken the origins of the Dark Knight into a different direction, or at least to a better one. His film, Batman Begins, has the power, has the entertainment, and it doesn't cheat its target audience (the die-hard Batman fans) or the general public. There isn't as much humor as the first film (this film's only tiny liability), but there is that genuine dark sensibility that can take in kids as well as adults. That the story and characters are as important as the action sequences and fights is another bonus."
Batman,"Chris Nolan's 2005 Cult Hit 'Batman Begins' is one of my all-time favorite films. A fantastic film in all aspects! Nolan presents Batman like never before, he justifies everything and that too in the most interesting manner. I've seen this flick at least, 5-6 times and I keep loving it more and more and more. A winner all the way! "
Batman,"BATMAN BEGINS rejuvenates if totally regenerates a film franchise . After Tim Burton's idiosyncratic vision of the comic strip , the film series became very stuck with the Joel Scumacher version . You wouldn't really blame Warner Bros if they'd ended the franchise there and then due the law of diminishing returns .Indeed it might have been seen as something of a risk casting so many big name ( Read expensive ) actors in one movie . The fact that on its first week of release it only entered the top ten weekly box office must have frightened the studio executives , only to have their fears extinguished where the movie rallied strongly spending two weeks at the top followed by several weeks in the top ten "
Batman,"18 June 2005. I didn't go rushing into this movie, my wife made me. Thus, as soon as I could I was looking for things I didn't like about Batman Begins and naturally I found plenty of problems with the movie."
Batman,"And so the story begins. Well, according to 'Batman Begins' anyway. This is a very long film, but if offers a detailed account of Bruce Wayne's life, and for the first time in the franchise we really get to know the character. We know where he comes from, what motivates him, and understand why he becomes Batman. Bruce becoming Batman is shown in detail, and I enjoyed that."
Batman,"It had some original stuff that displayed intelligence and thought with regards to his suit, car and weaponry. It did try to dwell on Bruce a lot more and convey some of his darkness but I found towards the end it became very Hollywood-ised. Sometimes filmmakers try to over complicate things and this was a good example."
Batman,"What we see in this movie is the ""dark & gritty"" (TM) Batman, which was introduced by Frank Miller in 1986 in the comics mini-series Dark Knight Returns, which was an alternate future version of Batman. But Miller also gave the ""real"" comics Batman the dark & gritty treatment in the seminal Batman: Year One story, which is perhaps the greatest Batman story ever created (also because of the effective artwork of the excellent David Mazzuchelli), and which chronicles, among other things, Bruce Wayne's initial (pre-Batman) martial arts training in a remote mountain region. In the comics, a creative force as strong as Frank Miller was bound to yield massive imitation by less original comics creators - and so the early 1990s saw the Batman character getting consistently and increasingly dark & gritty, to the extent that the entire Batman universe was based on that darkness and grit."
Batman,"Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.the movie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped crusader.obviously,there is a fair amount of character development involved,which you would expect based on the title.but not so much that the film becomes tedious.Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional character than in previous incarnations.this version is also more faithful to the comic.Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director,pacing the film very well.there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne.The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of the genre,instead of simply being devices for the hero(the protagonist)to have a villain(antagonist)to defeat.Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles,as is Liam Neeson.Katie Holmes Has yet to reach the level of maturity require for her role,so she is a bit weak.This Batman movie is less cartoonish than previous efforts,and is closer to the realm of realism(relatively speaking)the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros there is much more substance.in fact more substance than style,though it is just stylistic enough.All in all a brilliant depiction of the origin of the caped crusader.this movie sets the bar high for its successor,the Dark Knight,which is to be released sometime in 2008. 10/10"
Batman,"I am reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of either loving or hating this film, because it appears that is the popular thing to do when reflecting on the films of 2005. I still feel that it is worthy of a great deal of praise as it brought new life to Batman after a series of failed films in the 90s."
Batman,"I don't worry and obsess too much about 'superhero' flicks. I just expect them to suck and take what enjoyment I can from them. So the relatively high quality and watch-ability of ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" was a great surprise to me, since I had fully expected them both to be lame, camp, and stupid. But instead, both flicks were well made films with warmth, dignity and humor, as well as being pleasant tributes to the memories of decades of entertaining stories and the comic book creators who made them."
Batman,"All i can say is thank you Chris Nolan,,,I still think you will have to be a magician to beat Tim Burton's Batman film's but Nolan has is well on his way to becoming Houdini. This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.."
Batman,"This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we've scene of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be."
Batman,"I just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must say this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of ""the young girl"" or ""girlfriend"". "
Batman,"'Batman Begins' started on the right foot and started the best superhero trilogy of all time. In this film, the protagonist character is so well represented, that the whole environment around him seems to reinforce his characteristics. Gotham City has never been so well represented, and the scenarios that gave life to the city made it seem that it was always night and that perfectly portray the darkness experienced by the bat man. To complete such harmony, the plot created in the viewer a sense of reality so well thought out that darkness seemed to be everywhere, except in the moments of light from Bruce's past in the dear Wayne mansion, or when it involved him with other dear characters, like Rachel and her butler Alfred. And, magnificently, the villains Falcone, Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul only magnify the story further by gradually causing terror in Gotham, spreading crime until it reaches the main point that gives life to the bat man, protecting the city from its own destruction, and justly the one who contributed most to bringing Batman to life became the one who most needed to get him out of the way simply because of a divergence of opinions that define a hero of the villain, although still within the line of justice. It is an intelligent morality and better preached than in any other superhero film, and that define hero as such, but that still makes you understand and admire the lines of reasoning of all the characters, including the villains. If you have never been satisfied with superhero stories so far and consider them silly, watch this movie and you will never have the same opinion again, and you will see that reality is much more like comic fiction than you think."
Batman,"Over the years the Gotham City that was once a dark place lined with evil and corruption, in desperate need of a hero, deteriorated into a circus tent of Hollywood displays with over-dramatic architecture and special effects... Where criminals dance around in blacklight sensitive face paint and so-called villains compete for best comedic performance. Behind all the bright lights and all-star celebrity casting, we lost grasp of what the saga is really about: Batman."
Batman,"I've just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan's previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won't give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect. "
Batman,"I never thought Christian Bale could displace Michael Keaton as the best batman, but, sorry Michael, the deed is done."
Batman,"Batman Begins, the much hyped, much publicised 'reboot' of the Batman franchise is finally here and boy what a treat it is! I was a big fan of Tim Burton's take on Batman, his portrayal of the dark knight as a brooding and reluctant bringer of justice, I always felt fit perfectly with the imagery of the comic books and gave a great feel to the whole Batman mythology. The following outings of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, were less than splendid though. Over-blown campy nonsense with two-dimensional characters being upstaged by a campy over the top rouges-gallery of villains."
Batman,"While I enjoy Tim Burton ""Batman"" immensely, I cannot stand this one. What are the problems with ""Batman Begins""? Well, I can name at least three ones. But what three!"
Batman,"""Batman Begins"" is the best batman film made so far. While Tim Burton's 1989 movie is already a box office classic, Batman Begins has all of the gritty power that made Batman famous in the first place. Chris Nolan has done what Tim Burton and Joel Shumacher couldn't do, which is make a comic book film true to the actual comic. While Nolan's direction is amazing David s. Goyer's script is great. "
Batman,"It's been a long time since I've seen the Tim Burton Batman films, heck, it's been a long time since I've seen this one when it first came out. But after seeing all three of the Dark Knight incarnations under Christopher Nolan, I'd have to say that his vision best defines the comic book character that evolved over the past decade. I never cared for the campy Adam West version of the mid-Sixties TV series, and even looking back at the early comic book stories, the appeal of the character was always geared more toward a kid's eye view of good guys triumphing over bad guys. With ""Batman Begins"" the character enters the adult world as a complex hero/anti-hero with conflicting emotions and a motivation in precarious balance between justice and revenge."
Batman,"Forget Joel Schumacher's camp, crappy Batman. Actually, with all due respect, forget Tim Burton's moody, dark take on the hero, too: this is the Batman film fans have been waiting for ever since Bob Kane created the character in 1939. "
Batman,"I have just seen The Dark Knight, and while I wanted to review it as fast as I could, I felt it might make more sense to at least review it's prequel, Batman Begins. Batman Begins is a really good movie. It focuses on Bruce Wayne's beginnings. How he became Batman, and why he did so. He reflects a lot about his parents' death from a murderer, and gets sent to jail after having his revenge (in other words, shot him to death). In jail, there is a mysterious man that will bring to another mysterious man by the name of Râs-Âl-Ghul, who trains him to become a warrior. And, after harsh choices, Bruce Wayne then becomes Batman."
Batman,"I caught this offering on a freeview channel. And at first I began to wonder if the listings had got screwed-up. Where was Batman? For a seemingly indefinite time, somebody - I suppose it was Bruce Wayne - was faffing about in what I think were the Himalayas. They were mountains anyway. There was a bald-headed monk with a self-satisfied gaze like a hang-over from Quai Chang Kane's adventures, and Wayne getting the crap kicked out of him frequently. Here, I gather, was supposed to be the 'why he became Batman' expose, but the whole boring and verbose pantomime went on for so long that this little grasshopper dozed-off before he could grasp the pebble."
Batman,"""Batman"" is all about a man who battles his enemies and inner demons. It's about fear, acceptance, morality and reality: Batman is not a superhero, contrary to popular belief. He doesn't have extraordinary powers. He's human, physically and emotionally. That is why Batman has always appealed to me, and I imagine many others feel the same way."
Batman,"Batman Begins - The beginning chapter of the Caped Crusader(played spot-on by Christian Bale)'s exploits in Gotham City. Chalk it up to the Brits to finally get a Batman movie right. Now don't get me wrong. I liked elements of Batman and Batman Returns, but for all of the beautiful sets and bangs and whistles, Batman was a 2-dimensional supporting character in his own films, and we never saw much of anything that drove him to don the costume and battle evil. Batman needed a beginning, and now he has it. The first hour is spent delving into Batman's past as Bruce Wayne as a child gets the crap scared out of him by bats, and watches his parents get murdered right in front of him (I actually cried here, to my surprise). It's dark, gritty, and emotional. We see Bruce get trained physically and mentally. He learns to harness his fear and use it. Fear as a weapon is a recurring theme in the movie, a key tool of Batman that was somehow left out of the other movies, and the old 60's show. Batman then returns to Gotham and vows to put a stamp on the corruption and evil."
Batman,This film is a whole lot different than the other Batman films.
Batman,"So they wanted to reinvent Batman. And they did it with a mentoring sequence, an evil mentor, a psychological problem, a Q from James Bond movies, a sweetheart from the childhood, good cop, bad cop, a scarecrow as an enemy, a drug to make the city in fear. OK. Good work."
Batman,"This is the best rendition of Batman ever. Perhaps for the first time a movie is better than the original comic. What makes this movie so great is the character development of Bruce Wayne and casts surrounding him being perfect. Sure the looks and the mood builds on the ""Dark Knight"" version of the Batman of the '90s, but this is more intelligently done, and every i's are dotted and t's crossed on it's plot, character depiction, and special gadgetry that Batman always flaunts."
Batman,"For those of you who were disappointed with the last few Batman movies, 'Batman Begins' redeems the caped crusader in a big way. 'Batman Begins' takes us on a journey through Bruce Wayne's tragic past again, giving us a real insight into what drives and fuels his quest against suffering and injustice. We discover how the billionaire came to be trained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his technological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance as not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the means to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also responsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we notice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the other movies in the series. This is however not a disappointing feature, in fact it seems to breathe new life into this timeless classic. So for all of us who have followed the Dark Knight's journey's, strap yourself in for a wild and inspiring ride."
Batman,"Those expecting a fine experience based on prior Nolan projects, even Bale ones, are bound to be disappointed. I was."
Batman,"This is my first post after joining the IMDb. And what better way than to start with my favorite Super Hero. Last night, I attended the opening night showing of Batman Begins. I came out of that theater in total awe and I am totally and completely amazed. They have finally made what has got to be the best Batman movie ever as well as the most real interpretation. I have to agree with Christopher Nolan's goal about making this movie turn out the way the first Superman movie of 1978 did and they executed it to the fullest. A true origin movie of Batman. "
Batman,"I've seen all of Batman movies and they were OK at best and sometimes awful .. I nearly lost hope of this series but when I heard that Nolan is directing the next Batman .. I braced myself to a very good movie at least and Nolan hasn't let me down .. it is the only Batman movie that you could call a masterpiece even people who liked it less consider it a very good movie and the best batman (so far). This movie is loaded with class A starts (like other batman movies) but they are the best of the best .. Liam Neeson & Michael Caine were very good .. Morgan Freeman wasn't at his best but he was OK at least .. Christian Bale is a unique actor and I think he will show us great performance in other movies to come in the future .. he is the type of actor he will try everything and anything that makes his performance good .. keep in mind his awesome performance in ""The Machinist"" .. he has a great facial expresses that he uses very good .. Gary Oldman wasn't very good but wasn't bad either .. Cillian Murphy also was very good .. even Katie Holmes was good. The visual effects were convening and were so realistic that sometimes I feel that they didn't use much of computer effects. What can I say about this masterpiece !! in short, Christopher Nolan worked hardly on this movie and he surely has lifted it up to the masterpiece level .. everything sounds prefect in this movie. Do not miss it .. "
Batman,"A well made action film, especially of its sort, it constantly tackles below surface ideas, such as justice, fighting crime, fears and corruption, while at the same time the film offers exciting action on the surface. The visual effects are very effective, and the overall visual style suits the project very well. Cillian Murphy is worth noting for an intriguing performance, even if the rest of the cast members only act adequately. The film is somewhat slow to build up, focusing on some of the story elements for too long, but once the film gets going, it is superb. There are certain imperfections that one generally accepts in these types of movie blockbusters. Yes, the on screen romance is dull, but at least here it is not a useless subplot. Yes, some of the characters are inserted just for laughs, and not to add anything to the story. Yes, even some of the necessary characters have pointless moments of comic relief. Yes, the special effects tend to go over-the-top here and there. However, do all these points really matter? If you are expecting a flawless masterpiece then they do, and you will not find such a film here. But, if you just want to see an action film that is a cut above the rest, this is a great example: a film that is engaging both below as well as above the surface."
Batman,"I enjoyed the film BATMAN from Tim Burton, though I'll be the first to admit that it was very, very dark and disturbing. I'd also agree that the Batman role in this and subsequent films was a bit one-dimensional--with a much greater emphasis on the villains and amazing cartoon-like scenes. However, despite enjoying the first film, the subsequent films were a disappointment to me as they just seemed overloaded with special effects and were a bit light on character development."
Batman,"Director Christopher Nolan pulls out all the stops as he embarks on solidifying Batman lore with his retelling of how one Bruce Wayne became the capped crusader Batman. Nolan dazzles in many scenes and is always rock solid, never resorting to cheap humor or unnecessary special effects. This Batman is a dark tale that explains why Batman is the person he is, why he became the person he was to be, and what lies ahead. Christian Bales does a credible job in the lead. He is surrounded by first-rate performers lending their experience and acting savvy: Michael Caine as Alfred(very, very good), Morgan Freeman as Luscious(very, very good), Gary Oldman as policeman Gordon(very good) and villains Liam Neeson(very good), the ever impressive Tom Wilkinson(excellent), and Cillian Murphy(very good). Rutger Hauer is also along as is Katie Holmes(big deal huh?) I really enjoyed this film and was impressed with its cohesiveness and strong script. The script, the direction, the acting, the sets, and the special effects all blend together and make a fine film and probably the definitive Batman film to date. I know many people will compare this to the two Burton films - both good films in their own way. But this Batman is not that Batman. There are no one-liners here and there mixed in with an occasional over-blown scene. This film is a very serious take on a very serious man that has devoted his life to stopping crime in Gotham."
Batman,"Tim Burton made Batman look a bit childish in Michael Keaton's figure, and were always beaten by his great villains in both Batman (1989) and the fabulous sequel. But then suddenly Joel Schumacher decided to trash and destroy everything that was cool, stylish and fascinating about the knight of night. So he made Val Kilmer do Batman and topped it all in 1997 by making the horrifyingly bad Batman & Robin that included a terrible Arnie as the main bad-guy."
Batman,"This, the first part of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is as much about how and why billionaire Bruce Wayne became Batman as what he does once he has; in fact he doesn't don the bat suit until an hour into the film. In the prologue we see a young Bruce Wayne fall into a well where he is terrified by the bats he disturbed; creating a life long phobia. The first time we see him as an adult he is in a Himalayan prison; he is released and invited to train to become part of an organisation called the crime fighting organisation; League of Shadows. Upon completing his training he learns that the league's methods are radical in the extreme... they intend to destroy Wayne's home city of Gotham and everything in it because they believe the world needs to be cleansed of its corruption. Gotham is indeed a corrupt city but Wayne is determined that it can be saved. He returns home and uses the resources of Wayne Industries to create his Batman persona."
Batman,"I was really in a hopeful mood when I went to see Batman Begins. I was measuring the movie, not against Schumacher's previous Bat-films, but by the Loeb/Lee ""Hush"" storyline in the Batman comic books, simply because that comic story is better by far. This, I must say, is the the best Batman movie yet. It really blew my mind. There was character, depth ... they really did their best to figure out why of all things would a vigilante dress up as a bat and fight crime in a metropolis. Their effort shows. Warner may have pumped more into the marketing than they could have possibly done, but they have the quality movie to prove it. I myself have to say if there is one Batman movie you must see in your lifetime, this should be it."
Batman,"Batman is such a Cool, Dark Character that No Matter how He is ""Drawn"" that Coolness is Teflon to Any and All Attempts at Bringing the Character to a New Palette or a New Generation. No Matter How or WhatBatman's Coolness Remains."
Batman,"While I wasn't totally blown away by Nolan and Bale's interpretation of how ""it all began"", I think it has its moments. Despite a busy plot where the League of Shadows adopt a broken Bruce Wayne, needing guidance and a path to a better him, train him in martial arts and how to engage, out- think, and outwit the enemy, and attempt to invest their philosophy on annihilating injustice (through whatever means necessary) among other things (dealing with Rutger Hauer's managing of his company, working in weapons which might not have been Pops Wayne's desired property in the business; trying to recover his shaky relationship with Holmes' assistant DA; building his crime-fighting lair, costume, weapons behind the symbol of the bat, what he fears the most due to being trapped in a well as a child; contending with a mind altering drug being used by Cilian Murphy's crazed attorney (he's the scarecrow villain); trying to recuperate from the loss of his parents and the nature of having to live up to his father's honored reputation; learning how to be the kind of crimefighter his father would be proud of...), I think there are distinctive personalities that work. Michael Caine as Alfred (never giving up on Bruce), the butler who has kept his affairs in order, Hauer as the company's chief operating executive in the company (with an obvious interest in attaining power in the company), Morgan Freeman as an old company employee in charge of a section of the company that dealt in ""abandoned weapons designs"" (Bruce's go-to guy for kevlar, the elaborately designed batmobile, among other things), and Murphy (the devious, cold- bloodedness is brought out well; that and he plays a prick, douchebag authentically) all bring it even if Katie Holmes (a target of undeserved vitriol) doesn't quite achieve what the part really needed, and Bale, while brooding and providing enough angst and inner anguish, speaks in that dark tone that has been quite the victim of mockery. Liam Neeson, as Bruce's mentor and adversary, is a bit stone-faced and delivers his lines as a man rooted in his philosophy to the point that when he talks about genocide to an entire city it feels like little more than crushing out ants. The action scenes are sparse, but not altogether satisfying to me. They don't have the pizazz I was accustomed to with Burton. The police chasing Batman in the batmobile, and the effects of the toxin on people, to me, are the film's best moments. Gary Oldman plays it straight in a part that he's seldom seen in...a straight-arrow cop totally in favor of justice. He plays the character with valor all the way. This isn't Romeo is Bleeding Oldman, for sure. Tom Wilkinson even shows up as a gangster running the criminal underground, victim of Murphy's toxin when he threatens to expose the plan to poison the city's water supply. A ton of faces, a lot of subplots eventually converging, and Bruce's developing into Batman: there's no way around a lengthy movie. Holmes, if anything, suffers from not having the right chemistry with Bale, but it works both ways. She just lacks this passion and energy the part kind of needs."
